        <p>Aline lives in NE Portland, in a small intentional community. 
            They live with their partner, two children (a 4 year old and a 7 year old), 
            and five other wonderful humans. When Aline is not providing doula care, 
            they might be planning community events and parties, dancing, doing pilates 
            and yoga, cooking, or spending time with their kids.</p>

            <q>A postpartum doula was, we thought, out of the realm of possibility for us. 
                We are so grateful to Aline for making it a reality. Their help and support in 
                those early days meant showers, naps, and hot meals for both parents. Well timed 
                reminders of self-care were both needed and appreciated. Aline’s respect for our 
                family’s values and decisions made me a more confident parent. Thank you! 
                Thank you!
