            <q>Aline was my favorite postpartum doula. They really made this new journey a peaceful 
                one. When I had so many fears, Aline just made my newborn feel safe by talking 
                to her in a nurturing voice the whole time, like a nurturing mom would, while I 
                got to be hands free for a bit. She brought resources that we expressed interest 
                in, like swaddlers, because my baby likes to be swaddled (and I got to keep a 
                couple!). I recommend Aline first because they were checking in as soon as they 
                arrived and were peaceful in every approach to make this transition into motherhood 
                a stress-free feeling. Thank you so much for your support!
