            <p>I believe every family deserves emotional and practical support during this 
                transformational time of life. I believe that every parent should receive kind, 
                non-judgemental, evidence-based care during the postpartum period, regardless of 
                race, ethnicity, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, or 
                disabilities. I also believe that my job as a postpartum doula is to encourage 
                the wisdom and intuition that already exists in every parent.

            <q>My favorite thing about having Aline help out was their effortless support, 
                attention to me, my baby, and our home. It really felt like having a friend 
                around. Aline was so knowledgeable and kind. If my only request was a nap, 
                they would always care for my home as if it were theirs, which was the help 
                I didnâ€™t know I needed!
