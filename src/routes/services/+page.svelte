            <q>It was so helpful to have your support and presence! I didn’t anticipate how much 
                I’d look forward to your visits each week. I found it so helpful to have you work 
                with our family and was impressed with how you integrated so quickly. You showed 
                the perfect balance of asking what we needed and taking initiative - the 
                postpartum period is hard enough and knowing you’d rummage in the fridge, deal 
                with the dirty laundry, and not blink at me in tears was just what I needed! 
                Thank you!
