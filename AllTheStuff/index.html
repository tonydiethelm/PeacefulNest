                <p>I believe every family deserves emotional and practical support during this 
                    transformational time of life. I believe that every parent should receive kind, 
                    non-judgemental, evidence-based care during the postpartum period, regardless of 
                    race, ethnicity, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, or 
                    disabilities. I also believe that my job as a postpartum doula is to encourage 
                    the wisdom and intuition that already exists in every parent. </p>

                <q>My favorite thing about having Aline help out was their effortless support, 
                    attention to me, my baby, and our home. It really felt like having a friend 
                    around. Aline was so knowledgeable and kind. If my only request was a nap, 
                    they would always care for my home as if it were theirs, which was the help 
                    I didn’t know I needed!

                <q>A postpartum doula was, we thought, out of the realm of possibility for us. 
                    We are so grateful to Aline for making it a reality. Their help and support in 
                    those early days meant showers, naps, and hot meals for both parents. Well timed 
                    reminders of self-care were both needed and appreciated. Aline’s respect for our 
                    family’s values and decisions made me a more confident parent. Thank you! 
                    Thank you!
