        <p>Aline lives in NE Portland, in a small intentional community. 
            They live with their partner, two children (a 4 year old and a 7 year old), 
            and five other wonderful humans. When Aline is not providing doula care, 
            they might be planning community events and parties, dancing, doing pilates 
            and yoga, cooking, or spending time with their kids.</p>
