        <p>I believe every family deserves emotional and practical support during this 
            transformational time of life. I believe that every parent should receive kind, 
            non-judgemental, evidence-based care during the postpartum period, regardless of 
            race, ethnicity, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, or 
            disabilities. I also believe that my job as a postpartum doula is to encourage 
            the wisdom and intuition that already exists in every parent. </p>

        <q>My favorite thing about having Aline help out was their effortless support, 
            attention to me, my baby, and our home. It really felt like having a friend 
            around. Aline was so knowledgeable and kind. If my only request was a nap, 
            they would always care for my home as if it were theirs, which was the help 
            I didn’t know I needed!

        <q>A postpartum doula was, we thought, out of the realm of possibility for us. 
            We are so grateful to Aline for making it a reality. Their help and support in 
            those early days meant showers, naps, and hot meals for both parents. Well timed 
            reminders of self-care were both needed and appreciated. Aline’s respect for our 
            family’s values and decisions made me a more confident parent. Thank you! 
            Thank you!
